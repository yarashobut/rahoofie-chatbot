gworl traveling the world w Ibrahim bc we both agreed thatas what wead do before marriage kids etc, But I'm not completely over abdo rn, so I don't know, I don't think it's fair to be with Ibrahim if

care routine put me on, Of course pookie, One min, At night I use these, U already have the hylarounic acid, In the morning I don't use a cleanser I only wash face with water because at night ur skin produces oils that ur face needs and if u use a cleanser u end up drying up ur face and stripping it overtime, i14I only use this in the morning it works well with or without makeup very nice very glowy not too oily, And I put rose water every two weeks ish on my face, SLAYYYY Sarah just got me this for Christmas but the other version, For oily and combination skin, Ok I'm excited to start again, Ok so rn imma just stay on what I'm doing which is cerave cleanser, hylarounic acid, and the la Roche Posay moisturizer, I hear conflicting things about this does it actually do anything, Bc some people say it breaks them out more, Esp bc it's fragranced or what not, Itas not fragranced it's natural extracted from rose, I literally use the one my mom uses for cooking, Itas sooooo niceeee, Does it do anything frfr bc Iall start using mamas too then LOL, Rose water is anti inflammatory so it helps calm down my breakouts and any redness, Idk I feel like after the night I use it my makeup looks sososoosos smooth and glowy, I canat Wednesday I have to go to New Brunswick to see an apartment for next yearrrr, Slayyyyy, Okay maybe Iall start using it, How was your day pookie I miss you,

time and everything but it's too much khallas it's suffocating, I feel like at swat my scope is never limited but here everyone thinks so narrowly, Thatas how I know I'm never living in nj bro, Not even sure I wanna live in America atp, I hate having this much free time and being around my mom this much I havenat been around her this long in 3 months I forgot how much I don't like her sometimes, Yeah bro, Why don't u like her rn whatas up, Never again, U always ask me this, I just don't okay, Itas, Itas Not the same, Bc it can change like my reasons used to always fluctuate w mama like sometimes I didnat like her bc she would make me do chores others it's bc she didnat let me go out etc, Yeah thatas valid, I just hate hate hate talking about my future with her because sheas like ayou know right after u graduate u have no choice weare all going back to saudia and ur coming with usa, Like what if I have other plans for myself????, aNo u can get a better job in saudiaa, Mmm okay, Did you tell her u might not pu w them, And u have other visions for urself, Would u want to go back to saudia, We don't have to talk ab this, I love you, Also I forgot the car rally for

someone to ducking snitch on me or something like that has to be it, Or she has like a camera installed on my body, What omg why, Its so scary how they know everything like mama just says it's bc they have a mothers heart like naw I know ur sneaky hiring spies, Bc she said that she knows I still text him sometimes. She won't tell my dad ever thatas for sure but she just said to stop, What the duck does that even mean, WHATTTTT, Like does she have freaking visions, How does she even know, I feel like sheas just guessing, And depending on ur reaction sees if her guess is right or not, Okay like the first time she caught me I wasnat careful so it makes sense. This time tho. There is no freaking way at all because I have not texted him in front of her the entire time I'm here or called him in this house, I mean I denied everything I was like I did stop talking to him, No but she either, Or, Has like visions and dreams, Dam wtf, Yeah she has visions lwk, Right, Bc what, Thatas what I'm saying bro, Bc yesterday she got mad and was like aI'm not delusionala in Arabic, But I don't think sheas rlly worried rn bc if she was she wouldave talked to me ab it which she didnat since that one time, LMAO, Haram lmfao, Maybe she knows it won't help atp, Maybe or she found out that I'm just a girls girl, I'm just gonna keep denying cuz I'm assuming that sheas going based on a feeling, yeah bc thereas no concrete proof ur in touch w him still, Maybe she has the phone plan that can see ur texts, Bc my aunt has that secretly w sammy, But I don't text him, Yeah but in my texts w u, On messages, It doesnat matter, They can see whatever u do on ur phone bc it's on the plan, No but insta ans snap and social media websites are third party apps that don't record stuff like that, I know my phone plan, I liked it up, Looked, And read everything abt it they canat do that, Oh okok, Good work soldier, Yes bro, Gtg eat brekky will be back, Okieeeee, Wyd tmrw, Hang out w me, Please, Please, I need to be far away, From home, I love you pls pls, i14, Eunice after telling the customer aokie dokiea, Okie dokie, Lemme just make sure w mama when im back home ofc, Why did ur mom call me lol is everything ok, Did anything happen, Donat answer it's okey, Or u can and tell her that I actually did stop talking to him, Unless u don't want to thatas okay, Nothing happened Iave been at work, Like would u be able to say that I completely ended things when I went to swarthmore but if u don't want to thatas really okay, Like I know it's a lot, I'm so sorry, Can u please update me I'm not home, Yaraaaa, Hello, Donat leave me hanging please, Hiiiii, Okay bye I just talked to her, I'm so sorry, That she brings u into this, I'm so so sorry, Like actually, I'm sorry I just saw these, I'm at someoneas house for nye and weave been doing card games I didnat have my phone, I didnat see u said to not tell her I'm sorry plus she didnat even ask tho she just said it as a declaration that she knew it's still going on yk, Did she say weare doing the breakfast on tues just us three ?

I canat enforce my own opinion on him yk, Like Iall respect his beliefs, What was his reasoning for this, i14i14i14i14, i14, Heas, So, Philosophical, Tmrw is the first day of Ramadan idk if I can go also, Also, I knowww, Itas okay I guess I'm just :I, Just?, Like thatas me rn, No emotions no thoughts, And thatas okayyyyyy, Itas his own beliefs, But it's also a matter of what kind of boundaries you have for your partner, Yk, Yeah, Like, Idk where I draw my boundaries yet, What would u do in my place, Call me, I canat mama just came in our room crying, Thereas so much going on, Omg why, Okay . When this happened a few months ago, I got really upset and I asked for space for a few days because that is where I drew the line and he KNEW it because we have had conversations like this before., But this is different because, Me personally, I would ask myself how big of a deal this is to me . And how much differently does it make you feel about him, Ur case was diff bc it wasnat ab religion yk, And your future with him. Does this change alot of things for you, It was, Ohhh ok, But it was still different, I still love him obviously, Yes, But idk, Ughhhhhhhhhhh, Just be honest that it is Lowkey bothering you and you don't know how you feel about it. Tell him because it's gonna bother you forever if you don't trust me wallah, WHY IS MAMA CRYING, i14i14i14i14i14i14, i14i14Nvm we good lmao, i14, Thank u for this advice I wouldnat have resolved this without u baby, Oh family drama but we got it resolved lols, I love you, Itas okay to care, About things like this, I know you don't want to seem acontrollinga or anything along those lines but that doesnat have to be the case for you to care you know, Hehhehehehe, thank you for saying that, My sisters are in the room and theyare sleeping so they said I canat ft, Can we text?, Or is what u wanna talk about not textable, Itas okay no worries bbg, We can also use signal if u want, There is nothing I wanna talk about really I just miss you, Do u love me, I need bestie reassurance, Are u mad at me, I MISS U MORE BRUH, I literally love u so much youave been in my thoughts and duas extra lately, I pray allah gives ur heart the ease and love u deserve in this life, How have u been baby, Youare so cute, I'm okay, Idk, I think, mmm elaborate, Everythingas weird, Like what and how, School or ur family or Joanna, I hate whenever my relationships with people change because I let it consume me more than it should, And I feel like I deserve everything, Mmmm I seee, Ans then I overthink so much and I know it's not worth it but idk I am too emotional to just let things go, I cry to sabreen so much, Your heart is just so big and it's okay to be heavily invested in ur relationships but ur right it just opens the door for greater hurt when those dynamics change, Youare so valid in that tho, Itas okay, To love and to hurt and to cry, I hate it because it feels like it's so easy for everyone to move on, You are by nature programmed to be emotional, And I am just stupid and a baby all the time, what is this about is it catie, Yes, People are also really good at pretending, They might be internally annoyed or sad about something and just never show it, But I can guarantee u they feel things, I don't usually walk around carrying so much hate for one person but when I do it's really a lot for me to do, I know it canat be easy bb, And it's rooted in the hurt she caused u, Itas not like u woke up and chose to hate her out of no where u know, The humbling treatment u had to put up with wouldave made anyone feel the same towards her so don't think ur over reacting, Ugh idk idk I always feel weird, And thatas okay, Have you heard of imposter syndrome, U should be feeling weird otherwise it would be concerning if u weare completely normal after experiencing all that, Yes what about it, Taylor used to tell me that I have it, I feel like thatas more with school stuff or at least thatas the context Iave heard it being used in, U think u have it in ur social circle?, And that I invalidate my own feelings because I feel silly if no one around me is there to validate them, mmmmm I see, No but she only brought it up when I talked abt my family and Dre, Freinds, And relationships, It makes sense, Do u talk to people when u feel these things? U should bc u can get the validation for them that u canat provide for urself just yet, Like whenever u feel sad happy annoyed angry etc talk to me or sabreen, But it's really ugly and needy to do that, Truly I think we can work on validating ur own feelings together with time, What if I'm crazy, No not at all wtf, Itas completely normal, No but what if I think it's okay to be feeling this way and I tell someone abt it and then everyone thinks I'm crazy, I dont want to be crazy, If I do judge Iall be sure to lyk tho don't even worry ab it, Like specially when everything happened eunice kept telling me I'm valid and then she turned around and told Catie everything and agreed with catie that it's atoo mucha like Maybe people will agree with me but they don't actually mean it and I'm actually crazy, I'm sawry, I'm just a baby, I think that was kind of messed up of eunice to do tho in the first place, It wasnat right to not communicate to u that she thought what ur saying was too much, Never be sorry literally what r u sorry for no, Ur not jusr a baby ur literally a human being with normal emotions??, No one is a saint that doesnat think or do odee things, You are rahoofie not an imposter not a baby not a crazy person u are valid and loved and sane and u are my rahoofie, I love you so much, Thank you yaryoora, You are my baby, I wish, To see you soon, I love you so much more, Me too, Inshallah, What r u doing tmw, I have a gazeema but maybe we can do something earlier in the day, Iftar with parents, Wait shit I forgot my moms app, Mmmmm, Itas okay, I have to stop

protestors as Sarah deanna and I were walking to it saw us w kuffiyehs and told us to go back to Gaza like sir pls, The ones buying land, Thatas what it was for the estate sale for West Bank props, Property, Babiesssss :(, I was so worried when I texted u about it and u said u weare depressed wallah I kept thinking about you, Bro, No it's okay I feel like I had to go bc having that evil right in
