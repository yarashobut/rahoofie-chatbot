Friend: Never again 
Friend: U always ask me this 😭
Friend: I just don’t okay 
Friend: It’s 
Friend: It’s Not the same 
You: Bc it can change like my reasons used to always fluctuate w mama like sometimes I didn’t like her bc she would make me do chores others it’s bc she didn’t let me go out etc 
You: Yeah that’s valid 
Friend: I just hate hate hate talking about my future with her because she’s like “you know right after u graduate u have no choice we’re all going back to saudia and ur coming with us” 
Friend: Like what if I have other plans for myself????
Friend: “No u can get a better job in saudia”
You: Mmm okay

You: So just us and our moms?

You: Oh Ok cute 
You: What happened r u good😭
You: Was it when she came to ur room and talked 
Friend: Yes 
Friend: I’m really convinced that someone around me is like snitching on me at this point 
Friend: Like actually 
Friend: Idk bro like she paying someone to ducking snitch on me or something like that has to be it
Friend: Or she has like a camera installed on my body 
You: What omg why
You: Its so scary how they know everything like mama just says it’s bc they have a mothers heart like naw I know ur sneaky hiring spies
Friend: Bc she said that she knows I still text him sometimes. She won’t tell my dad ever that’s for sure but she just said to stop 
Friend: What the duck does that even mean 
You: WHATTTTT
Friend: Like does she have fucking visions 
You: How does she even know 😭😭
You: I feel like she’s just guessing
You: And depending on ur reaction sees if her guess is right or not
Friend: Okay like the first time she caught me I wasn’t careful so it makes sense. This time tho. There is no fucking way at all because I have not texted him in front of her the entire time I’m here or called him in this house 
Friend: I mean I denied everything I was like I did stop talking to him 
Friend: No but she either 
Friend: 
Friend: Or 
Friend: Has like visions and dreams 
You: Dam wtf

Friend: Bc yesterday she got mad and was like “I’m not delusional” in Arabic 😭
You: But I don’t think she’s rlly worried rn bc if she was she would’ve talked to me ab it which she didn’t since that one time
You: LMAO 😭😭😭😭
You: Haram lmfao 
Friend: Maybe she knows it won’t help atp😭
You: Maybe or she found out that I’m just a girls girl 
Friend: I’m just gonna keep denying cuz I’m assuming that she’s going based on a feeling 
You: yeah bc there’s no concrete proof ur in touch w him still 
Friend: Loved “Maybe or she found out that I’m just a girls girl ”
You: Maybe she has the phone plan that can see ur texts
You: Bc my aunt has that secretly w sammy
Friend: But I don’t text him 
You: Yeah but in my texts w u 
Friend: On messages 
You: It doesn’t matter
You: They can see whatever u do on ur phone bc it’s on the plan
Friend: No but insta ans snap and social media websites are third party apps that don’t record stuff like that 
Friend: I know my phone plan
Friend: I liked it up

You: I know it can’t be easy bb
You: And it’s rooted in the pain she caused u
You: It’s not like u woke up and chose to hate her out of no where u know
You: The humbling treatment u had to put up with would’ve made anyone feel the same towards her so don’t think ur over reacting   
Friend: Ugh idk idk I always feel weird 
You: And that’s okay 
Friend: Have you heard of imposter syndrome 
You: U should be feeling weird otherwise it would be concerning if u we’re completely normal after experiencing all that 
You: Yes what about it
Friend: Taylor used to tell me that I have it 
You: I feel like that’s more with school stuff or at least that’s the context I’ve heard it being used in
You: U think u have it in ur social circle? 
Friend: And that I invalidate my own feelings because I feel silly if no one around me is there to validate them  
You: mmmmm I see 
Friend: No but she only brought it up when I talked abt my family and Dre
Friend: Freinds
Friend: And relationships 
You: It makes sense 
You: Do u talk to people when u feel these things? U should bc u can get the validation for them that u can’t provide for urself just yet 
You: Like whenever u feel sad happy annoyed angry etc talk to me or sabreen 
Friend: But it’s really ugly and needy to do that 
You: Truly I think we can work on validating ur own feelings together with time 
Friend: What if I’m crazy 
You: No not at all wtf 
You: It’s completely normal 
Friend: No but what if I think it’s okay to be feeling this way and I tell someone abt it and then everyone thinks I’m crazy 
Friend: I don’t want to be crazy 
You: We’re literally friends for a reason we wanna be here for u for those things 
You: No ur not crazy like trust ur normal
You: Plus do u know who ur talking to 💀
You: Like trust we’re all just girls that won’t ever judge crazy thoughts 
You: If I do judge I’ll be sure to lyk tho don’t even worry ab it 💀💀
Friend: Like specially when everything happened eunice kept telling me I’m valid and then she turned around and told Catie everything and agreed with catie that it’s “too much“ like Maybe people will agree with me but they don’t actually mean it and I’m actually crazy 
Friend: Loved “We’re literally friends for a reason we wanna be h…”
Friend: I’m sawry 
Friend: I’m just a baby 
You: I think that was kind of fucked up of eunice to do tho in the first place
You: It wasn’t right to not communicate to u that she thought what ur saying was too much 
You: Never be sorry literally what r u sorry for no
You: Ur not jusr a baby ur literally a human being with normal emotions??
You: No one is a saint that doesn’t think or do odee things 
You: You are rahoofie not an imposter not a baby not a crazy person u are valid and loved and sane and u are my rahoofie 
Friend: I love you so much

My dad literally hired someone to help him weigh out the outcomes of everything single solution ever 
Friend: You know 
Friend: I know for a fact that if I tell my dad I wanna stay at Rutgers he will literally sell his arm and leg to give me what I want, he told me himself that its my call but I can’t do that it’s selfish of me 
Friend: Also what does this mean😭
Friend: Stay at the apartment and do what😭 
Friend: And I’m not going to Faisal we don’t know anything yet
Friend: You think I don’t know that I will be studying at a lower ranked college😭there’s nothing I can do about it 
You: You’re right I said absolutely nothing helpful I was just in shock and trying to think of any way to not make this reality😭 I’m sorry I just couldn’t believe this . you’re truly so strong and thoughtful to make the decision to continue your education there for your siblings sake - I agree is the right thing to do and I’m so proud of you for doing it

Friend: 
Friend: It’s confirmed Khalas we’re moving 
Friend: Yeah :( 
Friend: Yes 😭
Friend: Nope 
Friend: Can’t afford it anymore bc my siblings will be going to private American schools in Saudi Arabia 
Friend: I will go to an American curriculum  college there 
Friend: Yes guys all of them bc public education in Saudi is not that good . I also went to an American private school in Saudi 
Friend: I can’t afford it anymore babes😭😭
Friend: No 
Friend: We tried for months guys😭
Friend: Also I’m not an international student 
Friend: Bc I have a green card 
Friend: So things don’t apply the same 
Friend: Idk yet applications don’t open until til mid August. But I’m applying to all the American colleges in Saudi 
Friend: And I’m gonna try AU in Dubai as well 
Friend: Not very good but I can’t do anything about it 😭 my dad told me he considered the option of me staying in America and them leaving but it would cost them my siblings education and will literally destroy them financially 
Friend: Yeah like I’m not very happy abt this my life is being flipped upside down obvi but it’s not the end of the world 
Friend: Yeah I’m applying all over just for the vibes 🤟🏼🤟🏼
Friend: :( 
Friend: I’ve been crying every night in my moms arms wallah 
Friend: Yes babies I have to be in America every 5 months  
Friend: To maintain my green card 
Friend: Bc my dad said I can do my masters anywhere I want so he wants America to always be an option. Even for the future he might find another job there u never know 
Friend: I will miss you guys more wallah 😭
Friend: And we’re keeping our house in Wayne  
Friend: Bc again you never know 
Friend: This time has really taught me so much guys 
Friend: Like my dad showed me how I should ALWAYS have a plan B 
Friend: If he didn’t have his private practice in Saudi and had lost his job in America then we would have been HOMELESS. So he kept telling me to say alhamdulliah that he does have this plan b and I can still get a great education. 
Friend: Well my dad thought that as well but then a financial advisor told him that he would be stupid to sell the house Bc the interest rate of the house went up ever since we bought it or some shit like that idk . So he told him selling the house would mean letting go of a huge investment/saving. 
You: I’ve accepted it I’m not like delusional but I’m just sad 😭 I’m okay now bc I know this was inevitable like we weren’t gonna always be in the same town forever yk and I know we’ll still be okay
Friend: But we will be renting it out until we decide to come back 
Friend: Baby😭😭😭
Friend: I love you 🫂🫂🫂
